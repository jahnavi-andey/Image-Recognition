## Installation
- Install [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) by selecting your environment on the website and running the appropriate command.
- Clone this repository.
  * Note: We currently only support Python 3+.
- Then download the dataset by following the [instructions](#datasets) below.
- We now support [Visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom) for real-time loss visualization during training!
  * To use Visdom in the browser:
  ```Shell
  # First install Python server and client
  pip install visdom
  # Start the server (probably in a screen or tmux)
  python -m visdom.server
  ```
  * Then (during training) navigate to http://localhost:8097/ (see the Train section below for training details).
- Note: For training, we currently support [VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/) and [COCO](http://mscoco.org/), and aim to add [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) support soon.

## Datasets
To make things easy, we provide bash scripts to handle the dataset downloads and setup for you.  We also provide simple dataset loaders that inherit `torch.utils.data.Dataset`, making them fully compatible with the `torchvision.datasets` [API](http://pytorch.org/docs/torchvision/datasets.html).


### COCO
Microsoft COCO: Common Objects in Context

##### Download COCO 2014
```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/COCO2014.sh
```

### VOC Dataset
PASCAL VOC: Visual Object Classes

##### Download VOC2007 trainval & test
```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/VOC2007.sh # <directory>
```

##### Download VOC2012 trainval
```Shell
# specify a directory for dataset to be downloaded into, else default is ~/data/
sh data/scripts/VOC2012.sh # <directory>
```

## Training SSD
- First download the fc-reduced [VGG-16](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556) PyTorch base network weights at:              https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/vgg16_reducedfc.pth
- By default, we assume you have downloaded the file in the `ssd.pytorch/weights` dir:

```Shell
mkdir weights
cd weights
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/vgg16_reducedfc.pth
```

- To train SSD using the train script simply specify the parameters listed in `train.py` as a flag or manually change them.

```Shell
python train.py
```

## Evaluation
To evaluate a trained network:

```Shell
python eval.py
```

You can specify the parameters listed in the `eval.py` file by flagging them or manually changing them.  


## Performance

#### VOC2007 Test

##### FPS
**GTX 1060:** ~45.45 

#### Download a pre-trained network
- We are trying to provide PyTorch `state_dicts` (dict of weight tensors) of the latest SSD model definitions trained on different datasets.  
- Currently, we provide the following PyTorch models:
    * SSD300 trained on VOC0712 (newest PyTorch weights)
      - https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/ssd300_mAP_77.43_v2.pth
    * SSD300 trained on VOC0712 (original Caffe weights)
      - https://s3.amazonaws.com/amdegroot-models/ssd_300_VOC0712.pth
- Our goal is to reproduce this table from the [original paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.

### Try the demo notebook
- Make sure you have [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) installed.
- Two alternatives for installing jupyter notebook:
    1. If you installed PyTorch with [conda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (recommended), then you should already have it.  (Just  navigate to the ssd.pytorch cloned repo and run):
    `jupyter notebook`

    2. If using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip):

```Shell
# make sure pip is upgraded
pip3 install --upgrade pip
# install jupyter notebook
pip install jupyter
# Run this inside ssd.pytorch
jupyter notebook
```

- Now navigate to `demo/demo.ipynb` at http://localhost:8888 (by default) and have at it!

### Try the webcam demo
- Works on CPU (may have to tweak `cv2.waitkey` for optimal fps) or on an NVIDIA GPU
- This demo currently requires opencv2+ w/ python bindings and an onboard webcam
  * You can change the default webcam in `demo/live.py`
- Install the [imutils](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils) package to leverage multi-threading on CPU:
  * `pip install imutils`
- Running `python -m demo.live` opens the webcam and begins detecting!
